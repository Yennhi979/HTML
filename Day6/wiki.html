                        The battle of Bronkhorstspruit was the first major engagement of the First Boer War. It took
                        place by the Bronkhorstspruit river near Bronkhorstspruit in Transvaal on 20 December 1880.
                        Threatened by the growing numbers of militant Boers in the Pretoria region, the British recalled
                        the 94th Regiment of Foot, which had several companies garrisoned in towns and villages across
                        the wider area. The regiment's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Robert Anstruther,
                        led a 34-wagon column on a 188-mile (303 km) journey from Lydenburg to Pretoria. A Boer commando
                        force, led by Francois Gerhardus Joubert, was ordered to stop the British. Anstruther's column
                        was confronted by the Boers, who demanded that the British stop their march. Anstruther refused,
                        and the Boers attacked. The British took heavy casualties and surrendered after about 15
                        minutes; their surviving men were captured. Anstruther was badly wounded and died of his
                        injuries a few days later. (Full article...)

                Sheryl Cooper (born 1956) is an American dancer and stage performer. In addition to regularly performing
                on tour with her husband, shock rock singer Alice Cooper, she teaches, choreographs, produces, and
                directs children's dance and theatre in the area of Phoenix, Arizona. She was also one of three
                co-founders of Alice Cooper's Solid Rock, a non-profit foundation for inner-city teens in Arizona. Born
                in Denver, Cooper began dancing at a young age, training in classical ballet until the age of 16, when
                she switched to jazz. She met Alice in 1975 at the age of 18 when she became a dancer for his "Welcome
                to My Nightmare" tour, and the pair married in 1976. Cooper has toured with Alice throughout his career,
                dancing on his sets with roles including a sadistic ghoulish nurse (sometimes alongside their daughter
                Calico performing a similar character), a giant spider, a devil and a ghost. This photograph shows
                Cooper performing at the O2 in London in 2022, dressed as a Marie Antoinette–style character who helps
                apprehend Alice and sends him to the guillotine.
